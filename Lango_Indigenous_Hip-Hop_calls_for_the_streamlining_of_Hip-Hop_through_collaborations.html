                <img class="materialboxed imgsize" width="650" src="img/blog/news5.png">
                <p>Lango Indigenous Hip-Hop has partnered with City Beats Records - Apac, a recording studio located in Apac district and managed by a renowned producer, 2 years Pelare. The partnership that is aimed at giving the young creatives a platform to express themselves will run for two months and the 20 participants will come from the districts of Oyam, Kole, Kwania, Amolatar, and Apac.</p>
                <p>
                    According to Jaspher Ewany musically known as Dealrafael Jsp-E, the founder of Lango Indigenous Hip-Hop says with this collaboration they are looking at giving opportunities to the young creatives with a platform that will help to power their careers forward. While signing the partnership on 18th September 2021 in Apac district, Dealrafael Jsp-E said that the partnership will give the indigenous practitioners of any genre of music the opportunity to record and promote their music for free, create a strong listenership and bridge the marketability gap in the industry. The participants are required to write the songs with educative, informative and entertaining elements of music. “It’s our responsibility to design and implement initiatives that build our people and allow them to grow and thrive in this challenging world. Of course, as Lango Indigenous Hip-Hop, we are here to create futures, give hope and celebrate every life that we change. This is the first time we are partnering with local studios in the Lango Sub region and we welcome more partnerships of this nature to impact more on to our people”. – says Dealrafael Jsp-E, Executive Director of Lango indigenous Hip Hop.
                    
                    He said for a very long time they have not had a platform where the young creatives are involved and this collaboration will allow the selected artists to rediscover themselves, get a new experience whilst working with the team and be part of the Hip-Hop movements in the Lango Sub region. He further said that they are looking at young creatives who can change the community through music.</p>
                    <p>2 years Pelare, founder of City Beats Records in Apac district expressed his excitement in regards to this collaboration adding that he has been waiting for this kind of opportunity. “City Beats has been working with young creatives coming majorly from Apac and Kwania and the new collaboration with Lango Indigenous Hip-Hop gives an opportunity for City Beats to work with many artists coming from other districts in the Lango Sub region” – Says 2 Years Pelare, Founder of City Beats Records.

                        2 years says it’s always been his goal to help the artists who could not afford the studio fee but with this collaboration, he added that the most challenging factor in Northern Uganda is that the biggest population of artists are unable to afford recording fees due to the high costs.
                        
                        Lango Indigenous Hip-Hop located at Erute Road, Lira City East, Lira City is a foundation that strives to build a generation of youths making the most of Hip-Hop as a cultural tool to educate, motivate and to lead the people and facilitating youth and community development. The foundation has been working extensively in the communities of the Lango Sub region and specializing in long intensive projects in Dance, Music, Film, Art and Culture.</p>
